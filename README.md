# SET09117 Assignment
Dear Simon,

If you are reading this, then you are one step closer to being englightend. There is no folder called executable due to Unity throwing alot of errors after trying to rename it's execuatble folder "Checkers Tutorial" to "Execuatble". I hope you understand the problem and are okay with accepting the folder to remained the name of "Checkers Tutorial".

Respectfully,

Dan
